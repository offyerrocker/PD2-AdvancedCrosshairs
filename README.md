# PD2-AdvancedCrosshairs
Advanced Crosshairs, Hitmarkers, and Hitsounds (or "ACH" for short) is a mod for PAYDAY 2 that adds those things that I just said.
ACH includes several crosshairs, hitmarkers, and hitsounds in the main installation, but you may easily find others- referred to as "addons"- on ModWorkshop. Installation instructions can be found below.

==**Main Instructions:**==

PREREQUISITES: 
- SuperBLT: (MANDATORY) https://superblt.znix.xyz/
- BeardLib: (MANDATORY) https://modworkshop.net/mod/14924
- ColorPicker: (OPTIONAL) https://modworkshop.net/mod/29641

INSTALLATION:

1. Unzip the .zip file into your mods folder using the archive utility of your choice (I recommend 7zip)
2. Launch the game. You are now ready to use ACH and install addons.

==**Add-on Installation Instructions:**==

Addon folders should be installed in one of the following folders, according to the type of addon:

/mods/saves/ACH Addons/Crosshairs/

/mods/saves/ACH Addons/Hitmarkers/

/mods/saves/ACH Addons/Hitsounds/

Please note that the ACH Addons folder does not exist until you launch the game with ACH installed for the first time.
If you wish, you may opt to create the appropriate folders yourself, however.

For additional information, such as in-depth feature list or a tutorial on creating your own addons, please see the MWS mod page and the wiki:
